An application to share and read ideas about exercise with others. Users can also use an exercise generator within the application.

## Features

- Forum: Users who have created an account and logged in can share their thoughts on anything fitness related. If a user would like to see posts related to a specific type of exercise, there is a dropdown menu where each category can be selected. Logged in users also have the ability to delete their posts. If a user is not logged in (i.e. accessed application as a guest), they cannot add or delete posts. However, they can still view all content on the application.

- Exercise Generator: Users (logged in and guests) can generate a list of ten exercise ideas. These can be filtered based on muscle group and difficulty. These exercise ideas are pulled from the Exercises API.
